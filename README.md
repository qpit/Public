# Instruments

You've arrived at the Instruments GitHub repository. This README serves as a hub for insights into our lab's array of instruments. The repository is public, established for the purpose of generating QR codes. These QR codes will be fixed to respective instruments, offering guidance on their operation, initiation, and contact details for assistance.
