**Purpose**

The primary purpose of this repository is to facilitate the generation of QR codes that will be associated with individual instruments in our lab. These QR codes will seamlessly link users to pertinent information, providing insights into the operation, initiation, and contact details for assistance related to each instrument.

**How It Works**
- QR Code Linkage: Each instrument will feature a unique QR code that users can scan using their smartphones.
- Information Accessibility: Scan the QR code to access details on how the instrument functions, guidelines for use, and contact information for any assistance needed.
- QR Code Generation: You can generate static QR codes conveniently using qr.io
